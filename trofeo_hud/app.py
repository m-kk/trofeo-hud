"""The HUD main loop: collectors → render → panel, with reconnect resilience.

The panel firmware blanks when idle, so we stream continuously. USB unplug,
Mac sleep/wake, or a hub hiccup surface as connect/send errors; we close the
device and retry with capped exponential backoff. Collectors keep running
throughout, so the first frame after reconnect is current.

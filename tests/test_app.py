"""Main-loop behavior: pacing, reconnect policy, and — the point of this file —
what the loop must NOT do when a send is declined.

This panel's firmware carries trcc's `keepalive_stream` quirk, and trcc's send
contract for such devices is explicit (trcc/core/ports.py):

    # Single-session firmware: a close→reopen wedges the panel
    # until a physical replug (#228), so NEVER reconnect — soft-
    # fail and let the next keepalive tick resend the frame.

trcc converts transport errors into `return False` for these devices, so a
declined frame is the *normal* failure signal and must not trigger a teardown.
A raised exception is the genuine-disconnect signal and must.
